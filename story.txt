### Call me Andrew. 

Hi I am adding a sentence for homework.

Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no candy 
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on Wednesday, I thought I would drive about 
a little and see the old part of the city. It is a way I have of driving off the 
depression and regulating circulation. 
1. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the stock market; 
2. whenever it is a cold, breezy November in my town; 
3. whenever I find myself involuntarily  jumping before coffin car, and bringing up the rear of every lunch line I meet; 
4. and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a weird 
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately flying into the sun, and methodically 
cutting people's head off—then, I account it high time to get to my home as soon as I can. 
There is nothing surprising in this[^1]. 
[^1]: If they but knew it, almost all words in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the world with me.
